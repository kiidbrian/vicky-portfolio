# Why My Toddlers Are Better Negotiators Than Most Lawyers I Know

Every now and then, I sit back and marvel at the sheer brilliance of my children. Not just because they're adorable (which, of course, they are), but because at the tender ages of almost two and three, they have somehow mastered the ancient art of negotiation with the flair of seasoned diplomats 🕴️ and the persistence of a bulldog with a bone 🐶.

Here’s why **Ziv** and **Zoe** might just be the most effective negotiators I know 👇

---

## 1. They Know Their Audience

If I say **no**, they don’t panic — they **pivot**.

- **Ziv** clasps his hands together, looks at me with those big, imploring eyes, and says in the softest voice imaginable:  
  _“Pleeeeeaassseeee?”_

- **Zoe**, on the other hand, is a **strategist**. She plays the long game. She waits a bit, then sneaks up with a kiss and a glacier-melting smile.  
  Translation: _“Now can I have what I want?”_

---

## 2. They Use the Power of Repetition

In court, repetition can weaken your argument. In toddler world, it’s a **masterstroke** 🎓.

> “Juice please. Juice please. Juice please…”

Eventually, your resistance breaks — not out of agreement, but because your **sanity begins to slip**.

I’ve seen lawyers give up under less pressure.  
Honestly, **I’ve given up under less pressure**.

---

## 3. They Offer Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)

When a tantrum doesn’t work, they **shift tactics** with admirable grace.

- **Zoe**: _“Okay, no TV… play bubbles?”_ 🫧
- **Ziv**: _“No biscuits… just popsicle?”_ 🍭

They **compromise**. They propose **surprisingly reasonable solutions**.  
They are tiny **mediators in footed pajamas**.

---

## 4. They Understand Leverage

**Timing is everything.** And toddlers? They’ve nailed it.

- Ziv waits until **bedtime**, when our defenses are down, to request the **most random things**.
- Zoe waits until we’re already **late for school** to insist on wearing the **pink watch** instead of the **purple bracelet**.

They know when to **strike** — when energy is low and pressure is high.  
**Any skilled negotiator will tell you this: timing is gold.**

---

## 5. They Aren’t Afraid of Silence

Silence in court is powerful.  
Silence from a toddler is… **terrifying**.

When **Zoe goes quiet**, it’s not surrender — it’s **strategy**.

She’s either:

- Hiding crayons in unholy crevices
- Drawing murals on the wall

Either way, you’ll discover the results soon enough.  
**Silence was never passive. It was calculated.**

---

## 6. They Use Emotion as a Tool (And Win Every Time)

Let’s face it…

When a chubby-cheeked toddler waddles over mid-debate and whispers:

> _“Love you, Mamma.”_

The battle is **over**.  
Case closed.  
Toy granted.  
Cookie unwrapped.

You won’t even remember what your original position was.  
**You've been emotionally compromised. And they know it.**

---

## Final Verdict?

If toddlers ever form a **union**, we’re finished.

They’re already winning negotiations — **one juice box at a time**.

Honestly, I believe every aspiring lawyer should do a **3-month internship with a toddler**.  
They’d learn more about:

- Negotiation strategy
- Timing
- Emotional intelligence
- Persistence

…than any textbook could ever teach 📚.

As for me?

I'm off to **prepare my closing arguments** for tonight's **bedtime negotiations** 🛏️⚖️.

Wish me luck.

I'm up against **the best in the game**.
