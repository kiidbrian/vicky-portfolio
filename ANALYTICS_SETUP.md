# Analytics Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and Vercel Analytics for your Next.js portfolio project.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install @vercel/analytics gtag
```

### 2. Set Up Google Analytics 4

1. **Create a Google Analytics Account**

   - Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
   - Click "Start measuring"
   - Follow the setup wizard to create your account

2. **Create a Property**

   - Click "Create Property"
   - Enter your website name (e.g., "Victoria Paintsil Portfolio")
   - Select your timezone and currency
   - Click "Next"

3. **Set Up Data Stream**

   - Choose "Web" as your platform
   - Enter your website URL
   - Give your stream a name (e.g., "Website")
   - Click "Create stream"

4. **Get Your Measurement ID**
   - Copy the Measurement ID (starts with "G-")
   - This is your `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID`

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```env
# Google Analytics 4 Tracking ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your actual Measurement ID from Google Analytics.

### 4. Deploy to Vercel (Optional but Recommended)

If you're deploying to Vercel, Vercel Analytics will automatically work without additional configuration.

## üìä What's Being Tracked

### Google Analytics 4 Events

- **Page Views**: Automatic tracking of all page visits
- **Contact Form Submissions**: When users submit the contact form
- **Blog Index Views**: When users visit the blog listing page
- **Blog Post Views**: When users view individual blog posts
- **Blog Link Clicks**: When users click on blog post links
- **Project Views**: When users view project pages (custom implementation needed)
- **Downloads**: When users download files (custom implementation needed)

### Vercel Analytics

- **Core Web Vitals**: Performance metrics
- **Page Views**: Basic page view tracking
- **Performance Data**: Load times and user experience metrics

## üîß Custom Event Tracking

### Contact Form Tracking

The contact form automatically tracks submissions:

```typescript
import {trackContactForm} from "@/lib/gtag";

// This is already implemented in ContactForm.tsx
trackContactForm();
```

### Blog Tracking (Already Implemented)

#### Blog Index Views

```typescript
import {trackBlogIndexView} from "@/lib/gtag";

// Automatically tracked via BlogIndexTracker component
trackBlogIndexView();
```

#### Blog Post Views

```typescript
import {trackBlogView} from "@/lib/gtag";

// Automatically tracked via BlogPostTracker component
trackBlogView("Blog Post Title");
```

#### Blog Link Clicks

```typescript
import {trackBlogLinkClick} from "@/lib/gtag";

// Automatically tracked via BlogLinkTracker component
trackBlogLinkClick("Blog Post Title");
```

### Project View Tracking

To track when users view specific projects, add this to your project pages:

```typescript
import {trackProjectView} from "@/lib/gtag";

// In your project page component
useEffect(() => {
  trackProjectView("Project Name");
}, []);
```

### Download Tracking

To track file downloads:

```typescript
import {trackDownload} from "@/lib/gtag";

// On download button click
const handleDownload = () => {
  trackDownload("resume.pdf");
  // Your download logic here
};
```

## üç™ Cookie Consent

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Analytics Not Working
